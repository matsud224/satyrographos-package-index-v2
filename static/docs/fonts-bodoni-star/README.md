Bodoni* is an original font created by [indestructible type*](https://indestructibletype.com/Home.html). It is inspired by
the designs of Giambattista Bodoni. This is version 2.3.

About
-----
Despite the tremendous popularity of Bodoni typefaces, there is currently no digital family without compromises.
Bodoni* hopes to change that by being the first ever no-compromises Bodoni family, built for the digital age.
This font family includes a full range of weights, italics, an extended character set, OpenType features, and optical sizes,
totalling 64 font files. It was made with love and will continue to improve with your support.

Web Use
-------
To use on your webpage, simply put the following line of code into the `<head>` of the webpage you'd like to display Bodoni* and use `font-family: 'Bodoni* 11';` in your css. Make sure to replace 11 with the optical size of your choosing.<br>
`<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://indestructibletype.com/fonts/Bodoni/Bodoni.css" type="text/css" charset="utf-8" />`

Building
--------
I use fontmake to build the finished font files. If for some reason you want to build this font yourself, follow these steps:

Download the complete source code, either by cloning this repository or downloading the .zip file.

Download and install fontmake which can be found [here](https://github.com/googlei18n/fontmake).

Run the `fontmake.sh` script found in the "scripts" folder.

This should output two folders, an otf and ttf folder.

Run the `hinting.sh` script found in the "scripts" folder to make hinted versions of the ttf files.
