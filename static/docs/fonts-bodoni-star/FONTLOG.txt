FONTLOG for Bodoni*
===================

This file includes information about the Bodoni* typeface by indestructible type*.


About
-----

Bodoni* is an original font created by indestructible type*. It is inspired by
the designs of Giambattista Bodoni. This is version 2.3.

Bodoni* is designed and maintained by Owen Earl (https://ewonrael.github.io/),
who is the creator of the font foundry indestructible type* (http://indestructibletype.com).

Despite the tremendous popularity of Bodoni typefaces, there is currently no digital family
without compromises. Bodoni* hopes to change that by being the first ever no-compromises
Bodoni family, built for the digital age. This font family includes a full range of weights,
italics, an extended character set, OpenType features, and optical sizes, totalling 64 font
files. It was made with love and will continue to improve with your support.
